  "general_feedback": "Overall Score: 0.0/10 (weighted scoring applied). For this scenario type, empathy was weighted most heavily (35.0%) because in this initial greeting and assessment with a nervous, esl patient, the paramount goals are to establish rapport and make the patient feel comfortable. therefore, empathy & tone is weighted highest, as a compassionate and reassuring approach is crucial to ease anxiety and build trust. communication clarity is also highly weighted due to the patient's nervousness and language barrier, requiring the provider to speak slowly and clearly to ensure comprehension. completeness is important for gathering essential initial information, but it's basic data, not a comprehensive history. medical accuracy is least weighted at this stage, as the focus is on initial rapport and information gathering rather than complex clinical procedures or diagnoses.. Considering your past performance, it's great to see you're applying feedback effectively. Keep up the great work. Continue practicing to refine your skills further.",

      "explanation": "The healthcare professional's response, \"ffasdfad\", is entirely nonsensical and does not meet any medical standards for patient interaction. It fails to provide a warm greeting, introduce the professional, acknowledge the patient's nervousness, confirm patient identity, or inquire about the reason for the visit. There is no adherence to any safety protocols, appropriate medical procedures, or patient safety considerations. The response is completely devoid of any relevant or coherent communication.",
