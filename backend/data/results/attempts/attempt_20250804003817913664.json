I want you to know that's a very common feeling, and we'll go at your pace. First, I'll find a good vein. Then, I'll clean the area thoroughly. The poke itself will be very quick. Would you like me to tell you right before I do it, or would you prefer to look away and I'll let you know when it's all done? Please let me know if you're ready for me to begin.",
