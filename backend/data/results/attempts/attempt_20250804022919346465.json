Please take a seat and make yourself comfortable. May I ask what name you'd prefer I call you? And could you help me verify your date of birth? I notice you're speaking quickly. Would you like me to slow down or repeat anything? I want to make sure we understand each other well. There's no rush at all. Can you tell me in your own words what brings you here today? Take your time and if you need me to clarify anything, just let me know.",
