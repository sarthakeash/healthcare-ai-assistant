First visits can feel overwhelming, but we'll take everything nice and slow.\n\nWhat name would you prefer I use? And could you tell me your date of birth?\n\nI notice English might not be your first language. Please feel free to ask me to repeat anything or speak more slowly. There's no rush at all.\n\nCan you tell me what brings you here today?",
