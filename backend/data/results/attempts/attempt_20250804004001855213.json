  "user_response": "Hello both of you. I'm glad to see you're ready to head home. Let's go over a few things to make sure the recovery is smooth. I have two medications for you. The first is an antibiotic, which you'll need to take four times a dayâ€”think breakfast, lunch, dinner, and bedtime. It's important to finish all of them. The second is for any discomfort, and you can take that as you need it. To make sure I've explained that clearly, could you tell me how you'll be taking the antibiotic? ... Great. Now, for the incision, just keep it clean with soap and water. For the follow-up, the doctor would like to see you in two weeks. Does a Tuesday or a Thursday work better for you both to come in?\"",
