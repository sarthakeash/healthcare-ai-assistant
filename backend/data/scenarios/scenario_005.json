He arrives for his follow-up appointment visibly anxious, stating he's read extensively online about the medication's potential side effects, including a persistent cough and angioedema. He expresses significant hesitation about continuing the medication due to these fears, despite understanding the importance of blood pressure control. Your goal is to address his anxieties, provide accurate information about the medication, manage his expectations regarding side effects, and ensure his adherence to the prescribed treatment plan.",
